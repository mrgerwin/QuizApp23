Start by going to the file drop down and downloading the zip file for this repository.
Later I'll teach you how to make your own branches and such but for now this is just a way to get all of the files quickly.
Once the zip file is on your computer, go to it locally on your harddrive and right click extract it to your python folder that you have created before.
